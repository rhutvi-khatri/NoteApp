# Notes-App
Notes App is a feature-rich and resilient note-taking application that enables users to seamlessly store and retrieve all their notes and essential information digitally, leveraging a cloud-based database storage system. TypeScript is employed for frontend design, enhancing code maintainability and developer productivity. The authentication process is fortified by JWT, while local storage is implemented to ensure a persistent login experience. On the backend, Node.js and Express.js, written in TypeScript, collaborate with MongoDB as the database, facilitating efficient storage, deletion, and updating of notes.
